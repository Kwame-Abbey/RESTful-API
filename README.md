This project illustrates my first ever REStful API that i created.

Basically i tried following two rules in building this project. The first of which is to stick to using REST verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) where i related them to the CRUD(CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DESTROY) used for databases where;

1. GET =  READ in CRUD

2. POST = CREATE IN CRUD

3. PATCH AND PUT = UPDATE IN CRUD

4. DELETE = DELETE / DESTROY IN CRUD

Secondly, i used specific patterns of routes.
